<b> Progress So Far </b>
I created the methods to begin generating notes. Each pitch travels through four stages: attack, decay, sustain, and release. I wrote the methods to perform each of these tasks. I also wrote the Big 4 functions for the clarinet class. 

I have also begun building the user interface. The number keys will correspond to different pitches, and sliding bars -- as well as certain keys -- will be used to adjust the volume and articulation of the notes. 

<b> Issues </b>
Up until this point, most of my issues have centered around learning FM-synthesis. I needed to perform research to understand the process of how notes are generated electronically, as well as the frequency percentages that correspond to each step in the note generation project. 

<b> To-Do </b>
1) I need to add more documentation to the methods and instance variables, making it more clear as to how the application functions.
2) I need to add sliding adjusters to the GUI.
3) I need to build methods for crescnedo and decrescendo.
4) I need to build methods to generate sample musical pitches.
